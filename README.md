Welcome To Spaced Repetition!

Summary: We made learning a new language as easy as possible using an advanced learning strategy called spaced repetition. We have created an app that will allow you to use flashcards to memorize vocab, but we have used an advanced algorithm to determine what flashcard you will see next. The more often you get a word right, the less often you will see the flashcard. The more often you get a word wrong, the more often you will see that flashcard. Using this technique, I'm sure you will be speaking a second or even third language in no time.
